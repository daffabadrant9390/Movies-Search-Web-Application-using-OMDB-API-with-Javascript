Here, i created a simple movies searching app using HTML5, CSS3, javascript, and a little bit help of Bootstrap. The movies data are fetched from OMDB API. You can access it from this link http://www.omdbapi.com/

To get the data from API, i have to generate the api key from the website, then generate the link and api key from postman. After get the data, i fetched them using javascript method called fetch. Since i was using fetch, i have to modify my code into asyncronous using async and await. And also not to forget to set the error handler to handling the errors.
